web app, debt tracker

Product of Bitcamp, University of Maryland hackathon, Apr 4-6 (bitca.mp)

STATUS: incomplete

PURPOSE: For roadtrips, sports trips, or any event that involves multiple
people paying for multiple thing for multiple people. Simply create an 
event (e.g. Spring Break Florida '14), jot down the unique event identifier,
and log every transaction. At the end of the trip, the app automatically
calculates who owes somebody how much and sends an e-mail to the people
involved.

The point of this project was not so much to create a working 
debt tracking app (which would be better in mobile app form),
but to learn Flask. This probably means this project will never
be completed (at least, until I learn mobile programming), but the
skills learned here will be useful to web apps I build in the future. :)
